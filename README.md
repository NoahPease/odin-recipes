HTML Project01 Recipes
First Project from "The Odin Project" course.

For this project I will be creating a website that will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few different recipes. 

I will demonstrate the HTML that I have learned so far which should include the boilerplate, adding text, links, and images, and also creating multiple webpages that can be linked
